                <p>Father, the creator; Mother, Nature, daughter and image of the Father;
                Son, The Infinite Son, The Anthropos, The Primal Being, The Image of God</p>
                <p>The Mother and the Son intramarry. They form a union ☥ and together, male and female, ☥
                become One, completing the Nature Reality.   (Odepius complex: the urge of the Son to have
                intercourse with the Mother). The ankh, ☥ , symbolizes this: the merging of the female and male
                energies through the '○' and the '†', the oval and the cross. The Oval is well represented
                by the Womb of the Mother, the Cosmic Egg from which creation was born, the bounded infinity;
                </p>
                <p>
                Nature is the Mothers Womb, where all creation takes place. Being birthed into the world,
                the Son dives from his dwelling place into Creation. He becomes submerged in matter, forgetting his
                origins, but with an innate desire to return to the Womb. This is the Fall of Man, the leap from the Garden,
                the paradise of Unbounded Life, emerging into the World of Knowledge where Good and Evil exists.
